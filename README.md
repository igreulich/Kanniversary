How many Kardashians have you been together?
===
On August 20th, 2011 Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries were married. 72 short days later, they filed for divorce, ending the fairytale romance.

We have decided that, in order to memorialize the happy couple and their commitment to one another, we would celebrate the number of Kardashian marriages our relationship held. Or simply put, we would celebrate Kardashians, not years.
